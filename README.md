👋 Hi, I’m @oliyoung

Hey there! I’m a versatile product engineer with a knack for blending design, engineering, and product thinking to create software that truly empowers people. With expertise in Design Thinking, Agile, Lean, Continuous Delivery, and User Experience (UX), I bring both broad skills and deep knowledge to the table. I’m all about crafting solutions that balance user needs with business goals, ensuring products are intuitive, impactful, and technically sound. Collaboration is key for me—I believe the best ideas come from working together to solve real-world problems. I’m also big on clear processes and sustainable, high-quality results. With a culture-first mindset, I aim to create environments where collaboration and growth thrive, driving long-term success for both teams and products.


👀 I’m interested in building impactful, user-centric products that blend technology with real-world needs.
🌱 I’m currently learning more about advanced real-time systems and scaling tech for high-growth environments.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on innovative projects that challenge the status quo, especially those that help non-technical industries embrace digital transformation.
