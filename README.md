ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @oliyoung

Hey there! Iâ€™m a versatile product engineer with a knack for blending design, engineering, and product thinking to create software that truly empowers people. With expertise in Design Thinking, Agile, Lean, Continuous Delivery, and User Experience (UX), I bring both broad skills and deep knowledge to the table.

Iâ€™m all about crafting solutions that balance user needs with business goals, ensuring products are intuitive, impactful, and technically sound. 

Collaboration is key for meâ€”I believe the best ideas come from working together to solve real-world problems.

Iâ€™m also big on clear processes and sustainable, high-quality results. With a culture-first mindset, I aim to create environments where collaboration and growth thrive, driving long-term success for both teams and products.
